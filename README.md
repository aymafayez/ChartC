# ChartC

Main task:
- Your task is to create a UI element that can draw price charts
-  The chart can be scrolled left and right, and the candles should shrink and expand
relative to the frame in which they are contained.
-  Use UIKIT + SnapKit + StoryBoards for screen layout



# Introduction
- Unfortunately I don't have so much time to implement the bouns points so, I decided to implement the most complicated part of the project which is "the candles view".
- This project contains a candles chart that draws two different entries of the same currency
- The project is written to be simple and to present how I can use the "charts" library to draw and customize the candles chart. 
- Please check my Github account to see more open source projects that contain "Unit Testing", "API Calling" and "App Architecture Description"
